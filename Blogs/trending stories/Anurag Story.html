                  <p class="card-text">Romantic relationships are where we bury ourselves emotionally into our partners. It gives us purpose and opportunity for most of us to grow and plant ourselves. <br><br>

                    Handling romantic relationships was a relatively new experience for our warrior Anurag. He is 24 years old and is pursuing his PhD from a national institute. Anurag grew up and spent most of his childhood and youth in Farakpur, West Bengal. <br><br>
                    
                    He moved to Delhi for his Post-graduation, and upon completion, he shifted to another city to pursue his PhD in Physics. <br><br>
                    
                    Anurag has a mixture of activities he enjoys doing like reading, listening to music and playing badminton. Having been somebody who earnestly follows a routine and exercises, he prefers to be healthy and take good care of himself. <br><br>
                    
                    Anurag elucidates how he was always an obedient student and would always concentrate in class. He maintains a disciplined and healthy life.<br><br>
                    
                    However, things altered for Anurag when he experienced his first flame of love. <br><br>
                    
                    He speaks of the ups and downs he faced in his 12 months of relationship and how he has grown into the person he is today. 
                    
                    </p>

                    <img src="./images/anurag1.png" alt="" class="secondimg">
                    <p class="blockquote"><em>“Everything sailed smoothly until my partner’s family figured out about our relationship. They pressured her to stop talking to me and wanted us to break up.” </em></p>

                    <p>This took a toll on Anurag’s mental health. He describes how the emotional turmoil he underwent affected him physically as well. <br><br>

                        “I remember having suffered from indigestion and used to feel nauseous every time I pondered upon our memories together.”<br><br>
                        
                        Anurag sought therapy after his institution partnered with YourDOST. He believed he needed somebody to speak to who he could rely on </p>

                        <p class="blockquote"><em>“I was insecure about my break-up and felt that disclosing it to everybody would leave me looking like a laughing stock.”
                        </em></p>

                    <p>
                        He was looking out for trustworthy people and this was when he met with his counselor Sharmili Ghosh. <br><br>
                        
                        “Sharmili is a unique person and a very patient listener. She is also very compassionate and made me realise my emotions and from where they spurred” <br><br>
                        
                        Anurag described how before seeking therapy with YourDOST, he would cry and discuss with his handful of friends, who he most trusted.  <br><br>
                        
                        He feels it is always a gamble discussing our hardships with our friends. It can be misused leaving us hostile in most cases. <br><br>
                        
                        Anurag mentions how making the right kind of friendship was essential for him to deal with his mental health. <br><br>
                        
                        Anurag’s transformation was concrete as he says he is a better person now who is maturely handling his emotions. His pain has reduced drastically after conversing with his counselor. <br><br>
                        
                        He is a more confident person now, especially after handling his break-up and wishes happiness and health for his ex-partner. <br><br>
                        
                        On the bright side, Anurag’s situation has helped him identify a more calm, mature and confident version of himself.
                    </p>

                    <p class="blockquote"><em>“My counselor Sharmili, suggested I jot down my thoughts in a journal and imagine myself sitting in front of her and just speaking things out in front of a mirror every time something got difficult.” 
                    </em></p>
                    
                    <p>It helped Anurag revitalise his emotional energy and stay afloat with his mental health.              </p>
                    <img src="./images/anurag2.png" alt="" class="secondimg">

                   
                    <p>Hope is like the butterfly that hangs on to the horse’s back. It can take you far when you lay weak. The world needs hope and empathy for a brave new future. <br><br>

                        Anurag feels that he is more upfront with his emotions now. Anurag rated himself a 3.5 on 5 in terms of his progress and we know he is already on his path to betterment.
